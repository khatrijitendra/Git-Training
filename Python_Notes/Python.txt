when we execute a source code , Python compiles it into byte code.
 Compilation is a translation step, and the byte code is low level platform-independent representation of source code. 
Python byte code is not binary machine code .
Python translate each statement of the source code into byte code instructions by decomposing them into indivisual steps.
Byte code translation is performed to speed execution
Byte code run more quickly than source code .It has .pyc extension
it will be written if it can write to our machine.
So, next time we run the same program. Python will load the .pyc file and skip the compilation step unless it been changed.

Python virtual machine
Once our program compiled into byte code, it is shipped off for execution to Python Virtual Machine (PVM) .
PVM is not separate program , It need not  be installed by itself.
PVM is just big loop that iterates through our byte code instruction, one by one, to carry out their operation.
PVM is the runtime engine of python.
It's the  component that truly runs our Script.

Python performance 
Unlike other compiled languages, Python code runs immediately after it is written. Byte code is a Python-specific representation.
